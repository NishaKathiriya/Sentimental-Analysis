# Sentiment Analysis Web App
This project provides a user-friendly web interface for sentiment analysis, leveraging various libraries for natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning.

## Libraries Used:
- NumPy: For efficient numerical operations and array manipulation.
- Keras: A high-level neural networks API for building and training deep learning models.
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Used for tokenization, a crucial step in processing textual data.
## Dependencies:
- Python
- NumPy
- Keras
- NLTK
## Features:
- Sentiment Analysis: The web app utilizes a deep learning model built with Keras to perform sentiment analysis on text inputs.
- LSTM Model: A Sequential model with LSTM layers for effective sequence processing.
- Tokenization: NLTK's word_tokenize function is used for breaking down text into words.
## Training the Model:
- The sentiment analysis model is trained on the IMDB dataset using Keras.
- LSTM layers are employed for effective sequence learning.
- Adjust hyperparameters in the model as needed for your specific use case.
